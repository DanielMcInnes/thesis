title = "Tool support for correctness-by-construction",
abstract = "Correctness-by-Construction (CbC) is an approach to incrementally create formally correct programs guided by pre- and postcondition specifications. A program is created using refinement rules that guarantee the resulting implementation is correct with respect to the specification. Although CbC is supposed to lead to code with a low defect rate, it is not prevalent, especially because appropriate tool support is missing. To promote CbC, we provide tool support for CbC-based program development. We present CorC, a graphical and textual IDE to create programs in a simple while-language following the CbC approach. Starting with a specification, our open source tool supports CbC developers in refining a program by a sequence of refinement steps and in verifying the correctness of these refinement steps using the theorem prover KeY. We evaluated the tool with a set of standard examples on CbC where we reveal errors in the provided specification. The evaluation shows that our tool reduces the verification time in comparison to post-hoc verification.",

@misc{JuhaszUri2014VAVI,
abstract = {<p>The automation of verification techniques based on firstorder logic specifications has benefited greatly from verification infrastructures such as Boogie and Why. These offer an intermediate language that can express diverse language features and verification techniques, as well as back-end tools such as verification condition generators. However, these infrastructures are not well suited for verification techniques based on separation logic and other permission logics, because they do not provide direct support for permissions and because existing tools for these logics often prefer symbolic execution over verification condition generation. Consequently, tool support for these logics is typically developed independently for each technique, dramatically increasing the burden of developing automatic tools for permission-based verification. In this paper, we present a verification infrastructure whose intermediate language supports an expressive permission model natively. We provide tool support, including two back-end verifiers, one based on symbolic execution, and one on verification condition generation; this facilitates experimenting with the two prevailing techniques in automated verification. Various existing verification techniques can be implemented via this infrastructure, alleviating much of the burden of building permissionbased verifiers, and allowing the developers of higher-level techniques to focus their efforts at the appropriate level of abstraction.</p>},

abstract="An ongoing challenge for computer science is the development of a tool which automatically verifies programs meet their specifications, and are free from runtime errors such as divide-by-zero, array out-of-bounds and null dereferences. Several impressive systems have been developed to this end, such as ESC/Java and Spec{\#}, which build on existing programming languages (e.g. Java, C{\#}). However, there remains a need for an open research platform in this area. We have developed the Whiley programming language, and its accompanying verifying compiler, as an open platform for research. Whiley has been designed from the ground up to simplify the verification process. In this paper, we introduce the Whiley language and it accompanying verifying compiler tool.",

This makes it a natural system for designing safety - and security - critical applications. This first introduction to SPARK 2014 will allow students and developers to master the basic concepts for building systems with SPARK. Software is pervasive in our lives. We are accustomed to dealing with the failures of much of that software - restarting an application is a very familiar solution. Such solutions are unacceptable when the software controls our cars, airplanes and medical devices or manages our private information. These applications must run without error. SPARK provides a means, based on mathematical proof, to guarantee that a program has no errors. SPARK is a formally defined programming language and a set of verification tools specifically designed to support the development of software used in high integrity applications. Using SPARK, developers can formally verify properties of their code such as information flow, freedom from runtime errors, functional correctness, security properties and safety properties. Written by two SPARK experts, this is the first introduction to the just-released 2014 version. It will help students and developers alike master the basic concepts for building systems with SPARK.},

@article{PhilippaertsPieter2014SvwV,
issn = {0167-6423},
abstract = {In this article, we present a series of four industrial case studies in software verification. We applied VeriFast, a sound and modular software verifier based on separation logic, to two Java Card smart card applets, a Linux device driver, and an embedded Linux network management component, the latter two written in C. Our case studies have been carefully selected so as to evaluate the industrial applicability of VeriFast. We focus on proving the absence of safety violations, e.g., that the programs do not perform illegal operations such as dividing by zero or illegal memory accesses. Yet, given the sensitive application environment of our case studies, these safety properties typically have security implications. In this article we give a detailed description of the VeriFast approach to software verification based on two of the above case studies, one in Java and one in C. Finally, we draw conclusions on the overall feasibility of using VeriFast to verify software components in industrial domains that have stringent requirements on reliability and security. ► We have verified 4 industrial case studies (Java Card and C code) using the VeriFast software verifier. ► We report on the findings (i.e. number of bugs found, time needed to annotate, verification time, etc.). ► We conclude that verification of industrial code is feasible. ► We give guidance on how to approach similar verification projects with VeriFast.},
